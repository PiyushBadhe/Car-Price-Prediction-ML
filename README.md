## Need of Car Price Prediction in the first place
Used Cars so called Second-hand's car have a huge market base. Many consider to buy an Used Car intsead of buying a new one, as it's is feasible and a better investment.

The main reason for this huge market is that when one buys a New Car and sale it just another day without any default on it, the price of car reduces by 30%.

There are too many frauds in the market who not only sale wrong but also they could mislead to very wrong price of a vehicle.

To overcome this frauds and misleading ourselves from fake and improper prices, here I used this *Algorithm* predicting car values besed on some of the main features defining the values of cars by using real-world *#CarDekho* dataset to Predict the price of any used car.

Car Price Prediction is a really an interesting **Machine Learning** problem for a *beginner* as there are many factors that influence the price of a car in the second-hand market. In this Project, we will be looking at a dataset based on sale/purchase of cars where our end goal will be predicting the price of the car given its features to maximize the profit.
