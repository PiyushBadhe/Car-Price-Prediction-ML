Car Price Prediction is a really an interesting **Machine Learning** problem for a *beginner* as there are many factors that influence the price of a car in the second-hand market. In this Project, we will be looking at a dataset based on sale/purchase of cars where our end goal will be predicting the price of the car given its features to maximize the profit.
